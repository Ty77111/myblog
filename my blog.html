                <p>My Journey Learning Ethical Hacking. As I embarked on the journey to learn ethical hacking, I realized that it's a practice that requires identifying vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications, with the goal of helping organizations strengthen their defenses against malicious attacks. To get started, I knew I had to gain foundational knowledge in programming languages like Python, C++, or Java, as well as understand networking fundamentals, operating systems, and master popular tools such as Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite, and Wireshark. Through online courses, books, and communities, I discovered valuable resources for learning, including Udemy's "Ethical Hacking A-Z" course, Coursera's "Cybersecurity Specialization", edX's "Penetration Testing with Kali Linux" course, and online forums like Reddit's netsec community and Stack Overflow's security community. As I practiced and honed my skills, I began to appreciate the rewards of this career path - job opportunities, competitive salaries, and a sense of accomplishment in keeping people's personal data and systems safe.</p>
